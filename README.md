# AB-Testing
AB testing is useful in many fields. In e-commerce companies can change their site. Like add or remove a feature.
Using AB testing we can see the effect of the changing on the visitors of the site. We can determine whether the old page was better or the new one.
We split the visitors into two groups, one called the "control" group which sees the old page, and one called the "treatment" group which sees the new site.
In this project I analyzed the effect of a webpage on the conversion of the visitors using python libraries, regressions, and bootstrapping methods
